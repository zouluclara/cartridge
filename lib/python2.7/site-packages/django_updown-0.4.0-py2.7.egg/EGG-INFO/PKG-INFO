        Usage
        -----
        Add ``"updown"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` then just add a ``RatingField`` to
        your existing model and go::
        
            from django.db import models
            from updown.fields import RatingField
        
            class Video(models.Model):
                # ...other fields...
                rating = RatingField()
        
        You can also allow the user to change his vote::
        
            class Video(models.Model):
                # ...other fields...
                rating = RatingField(can_change_vote=True)
        
        Now you can write your own view to submit ratings or use the predefinded::
        
            from updown.views import AddRatingFromModel
        
            urlpatterns = patterns("",
                url(r"^(?P<object_id>\d+)/rate/(?P<score>[\d\-]+)$", AddRatingFromModel(), {
                    'app_label': 'video',
                    'model': 'Video',
                    'field_name': 'rating',
                }, name="video_rating"),
            )
        
        To submit a vote just go to ``video/<id>/rate/(1|-1)``. If you allowed users to
        change they're vote, they can do it with the same url.
        
        If you're using Django version prior to 1.5, you have to add
        ``AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'auth.User'`` to your settings.
        
        ----------------
        Troubleshooting
        ----------------
        If you previously used this app you may get to a point where migrations are
        failing.
        Try::
        
            ./manage.py migrate updown --fake 0001
        
        to skip the initial migration. After this apply the migrations again::
        
            ./manage.py migrate updown

        Thanks

        Thanks a lot to ``django-ratings`` for the inspiring code
